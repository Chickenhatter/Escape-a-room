I made this for Hackclub.
The point of the game is to escape the room you are locked in. 
I have placed no lore in the game. 
This project should have no AI but the closest it would be might be 1% from me trying to learn how to code from people online

Buttons(BTW because I do not know how to do the other way you might need to hold down the button to use buttons)(Also QWERRTYUIOPASDFGHJKLZXCVBNM Keyboard)
-Use arrow keys for left right up and down
-Use C to change scenes by going to the telephone
-Use F to interact or search objects
-Use Buttons to place in passwords. You have to hold the buttons down
-Room 2(or 3 depending on who you ask) has a post which you will need to follow to get the passwords. Press P to pull it up and L to leave it when you finish with reading the poster
